# SQC Induction Website 2026

This repository contains the official landing page developed for the **Super Quant Club (SQC)** inductions at **NIT Jalandhar**. The project was designed to showcase a high-tech, data-driven aesthetic that aligns with the club's focus on Quantum Computing and Robotics.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The objective was to create a visually striking, single-page application that introduces potential recruits to the club's core pillars: Quantum Logic, Quantitative Analysis, and Hardware (specifically the **Chi Chi Robot Dog** project).

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Implementation
* **HTML5:** Structured for modern, semantic web standards.
* **CSS3 (Custom Animations):** * Implemented a **Glassmorphism** UI for the hero section.
    * Created a custom **Metallic Shine** text animation for the "Super Quant Club" header.
    * Designed a responsive **Cyber-Purple/Blue** theme to reflect the quantum computing vibe.
* **JavaScript (Canvas API):** * Developed a custom particle system for the background.
    * The script calculates real-time coordinates for floating data nodes, symbolizing a "Quantitative" network.
    * Optimized for performance with a dynamic `window.onresize` listener.

## 🎨 Design Features
* **Aesthetic:** Deep indigo and violet gradients combined with neon accents.
* **Interactive Elements:** Glow-on-hover effects for the Chi Chi feature card and social links.
* **Responsive Layout:** Fully adaptive grid system for the "Contact Us" section, ensuring the site looks professional on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🦾 Highlight: Chi Chi Robot Dog
The website features a dedicated section for **Chi Chi**, our quadrupedal robot. The integration includes high-fidelity imaging and descriptions of the sensor fusion and computer vision algorithms utilized by the SQC hardware team.
